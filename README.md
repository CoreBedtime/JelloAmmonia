## Usage

- Install SIMBL loader like using [mySIMBL](https://github.com/w0lfschild/mySIMBL) or [MacForge](https://www.macenhance.com/macforge). Note that you currently need to disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) in order for this to work.
- Download the [latest bundle](https://github.com/iamDecode/Jello/releases), or build it yourself (see Building).
- Drag bundle onto the app to enable it.
- Restart apps for Jello to take effect.


## Building

The Xcode project contains two targets, `Jello` will run a sample window with wobble logic enabled, `JelloInject` builds a bundle that can be used with a SIMBL loader.
